### CFoundry_Python4
#### Summary
> This repository is meant to highlight my work in Achievement 4 of Career Foundry's Data Analytics Program. Where in this particular achievement I was tasked with posing as a data analyst who was hired by "Instacart".

##### Objective
> "An online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns." My objective was "to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria." And in order to answer the questions posed the Instacart I was tasked with conducting the analysis in Python, "relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn) & data sets provided in the achievement."

### Additional context
> In addition this achievement also provided a series of questions said to have been asked by Instacart's key stakeholders that I was required to produce "data-driven" answers for based on the data sets again provided in said achievement.

#### Data Sets Provided
- Customers Data Set
- Data Dictionary --> The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017 Data Descriptions
  - orders
  - products
  - aisles
  - deptartments
  - order_products__SET

#### Key Questions asked by Instacart
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use
simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example
  - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
  - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
